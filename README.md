# MIPS-single-cycle--Processor-VHDL
This project implements a MIPS processor in VHDL with a 5-stage pipeline:

IF (Instruction Fetch) – Fetches instructions from memory.

ID (Instruction Decode) – Decodes instructions and reads registers.

EX (Execute) – Performs arithmetic and logic operations.

MEM (Memory Access) – Accesses data memory.

WB (Write Back) – Writes results back to registers.
